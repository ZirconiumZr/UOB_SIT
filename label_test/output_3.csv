51,52,107.02099773242747,107.35099773242747,0.33000000000000007,speaker 1,

53,54,109.93099773242747,111.22099773242748,1.290000000000001,speaker 1,program which john brought up
54,55,111.22099773242746,111.82099773242747,0.6000000000000003,speaker 0,copy of
55,56,111.82099773242747,112.60099773242747,0.7800000000000002,speaker 1,yum
56,57,112.60099773242747,115.30099773242748,2.7000000000000015,speaker 0,the familiar with that i sort of already have develop
57,58,115.30099773242749,115.72099773242749,0.42000000000000015,speaker 1,next
58,59,115.72099773242748,116.08099773242748,0.3600000000000001,speaker 0,

60,61,119.14099773242741,124.12099773242741,4.979999999999999,speaker 0,the question is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not have you looked
61,62,124.12099773242737,125.71099773242736,1.5900000000000007,speaker 1,does that mean i had a webpage up
62,63,125.71099773242743,129.70099773242742,3.9899999999999984,speaker 0,right so i actually mostly need to be able to
63,64,129.70099773242757,134.65099773242758,4.950000000000001,speaker 1,to link up or even if it's a question both of what the rapids and tickets i am going to be
64,65,134.65099773242775,136.12099773242775,1.4700000000000002,speaker 0,standing up and dropping yeah
65,66,136.1209977324278,146.50099773242783,10.379999999999997,speaker 1,we should definitely i'm so so it definitely had that as a concept so that it has a single timeline and then you can have lots of different sections each of which have ids attached to it and then
66,67,146.5009977324282,154.39099773242822,7.890000000000004,speaker 0,can refer from other sections to those ids if you want to so that so that you start with with a time
67,68,154.3909977324285,155.2609977324285,0.8700000000000002,speaker 1,wind tag
68,69,155.26099773242854,159.37099773242855,4.110000000000003,speaker 0,timeline

70,71,162.4609977324288,166.84099773242883,4.380000000000003,speaker 0,remember exactly what my notation was but i remember those yeah yeah ty
71,72,107.02099773242747,107.74099773242747,0.7200000000000001,speaker 0,the channel
72,73,107.74099773242747,110.53099773242748,2.7900000000000014,speaker 1,i used output of dave gilbert's program which
73,74,110.53099773242747,117.13099773242746,6.599999999999992,speaker 0,john brought a copy of yeah i'm familiar with it i sort of already have developed an xml format
74,75,117.13099773242745,117.82099773242746,0.6900000000000002,speaker 1,four

76,77,119.6209977324274,124.78099773242741,5.160000000000002,speaker 1,and is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not have you looked at that
77,78,124.7809977324274,128.2609977324274,3.480000000000002,speaker 0,if the webpage up right so i actually
78,79,128.2609977324275,129.13099773242752,0.8700000000000001,speaker 1,mostly neat

83,84,133.72099773242772,134.56099773242772,0.8400000000000002,speaker 0,i guess i am going to be
84,85,134.56099773242775,137.65099773242775,3.089999999999998,speaker 1,standing up and talking to you should definitely i'm so sorry

86,87,143.23099773242808,145.7809977324281,2.5500000000000003,speaker 1,i have lots of different sections each of which have ids
87,88,145.78099773242818,146.59099773242818,0.8100000000000004,speaker 0,add to it and then you can
88,89,146.5909977324282,147.4609977324282,0.87,speaker 1,i refer from others
89,90,147.46099773242824,148.90099773242824,1.4400000000000008,speaker 0,actions to those ids
90,91,148.9009977324283,151.0009977324283,2.1000000000000005,speaker 1,if you want to so

92,93,155.35099773242854,157.00099773242854,1.6500000000000012,speaker 1,

96,97,163.24099773242884,163.90099773242883,0.6600000000000001,speaker 1,in my notation
97,98,163.90099773242886,164.5309977324289,0.6300000000000001,speaker 0,it was
98,99,164.5309977324289,166.02897959183784,1.497981859408954,speaker 1,i remember a
99,100,166.02897959183784,166.77897959183784,0.7500000000000004,speaker 1,yeah ty

101,102,168.48897959183785,173.70897959183785,5.220000000000002,speaker 1,three two and then i i also had optional things like accuracy
102,103,173.70897959183785,174.54897959183785,0.8400000000000005,speaker 0,see

104,105,178.62897959183778,180.60897959183777,1.9800000000000009,speaker 0,and then
105,106,180.6089795918377,183.18897959183772,2.580000000000002,speaker 1,i also wanted to to be
