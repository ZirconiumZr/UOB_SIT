Training data preparation for DeepSpeech:

Note: please write the needed csv file on the company laptop, later upload on internship2022 cloud folder. We will finally fine-tune the model on company Desktop computer

Original audio: 181.wav   142.wav

Take 181.wav for example:

Step1:
Transform the 181.wav to channel=1(mono), sample rate=16000

Step2:
Cut the 181.wav by sentences (now we use the Resemblyer SD result audio slices)
(Note: step1 and step2 can change order, we can use slice to listen and write the transcript csv first and then write loops to do uniform formatting of audio slices)
Zip those audio slices cut from 181.wav --> to 181.zip
The files in zip:
181/1.wav
181/2.wav
181/3.wav

Step3:
Write the testdata.csv, the format is as follows:
181_testdata.csv:
wav_filename	wav_filesize	transcript
181/1.wav	218	the server is connected to all the car parks and visitors will be able to see which car park is more available

181/2.wav	406	if the user does not show up in twenty minutes the reservation will automatically be cancelled
181/3.wav	437	users are required to link a bank card or other mobile transaction agent

Text(transcript) requirements:
No capitalization, no numbers, no punctuation, only lowercase letters in the text.


With the 181_testdata.csv and 181.zip, we can train the Deepspeech model, get a new model with Updated parameters
